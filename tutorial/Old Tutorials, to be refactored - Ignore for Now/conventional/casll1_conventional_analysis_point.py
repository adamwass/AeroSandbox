if __name__ == '__main__':  # If you're a Windows user, you must run within a main block if you want to use any parallel functions.

    ########## First, define the airfoils that you want to use. ##########
    # For a lifting line analysis like CasLL1, you need differentiable 2D sectional data for the airfoils.
    # There are two ways you can do this:
    #   1. You can automatically fit functions to automated XFoil runs.
    #   2. You can provide explicit (possibly nonlinear) functions for CL, CDp, and Cm for each airfoil.
    # In this example, we're using an Eppler 216 airfoil for the wing and NACA0008 airfoils everywhere else.
    # I'll show you what both methods to get data look like!

    ### Method 1: XFoil Fitting
    # Here, we run XFoil (by default in parallel) and make automated fits to this data.

    # I've wrapped these in a simple caching script, since the XFoil runs are slow!
    try:
        with open("e216.pkl", "rb") as f:
            e216 = pickle.load(f)
    except:
        e216 = Airfoil("e216")  # You can use the string of any airfoil from the UIUC database here!
        e216.populate_sectional_functions_from_xfoil_fits()
        with open("e216.pkl", "wb+") as f:
            pickle.dump(e216, f)

    try:
        with open("naca0008.pkl", "rb") as f:
            naca0008 = pickle.load(f)
    except:
        naca0008 = Airfoil("naca0008")  # You can also give NACA airfoils!
        # You can also load from a .dat file (see Airfoil constructor docstring for syntax)!
        naca0008.populate_sectional_functions_from_xfoil_fits()
        with open("naca0008.pkl", "wb+") as f:
            pickle.dump(naca0008, f)

    ### Method 2: Explicit fits (look here in the library to see what these look like)
    # These will be generally faster to run, and probably more accurate. They can also tell you things about
    # control surface deflections or transonic performance (so long as you make fits accordingly). However,
    # right now, they require a good bit of manual labor to individually fit and make.

    #   at high CL, and XFLR5 makes no adjustments for this. This will also mean that XFLR5 will
    #   overpredict drag (in particular induced drag), since the circulation is overpredicted.
